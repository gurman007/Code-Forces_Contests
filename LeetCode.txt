402. Remove K Digits...      (Recursive to Monotonic Stack)		 	https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/discuss/1395112/JAVA-Bruteforce-greater-Memoization-greater-Greedy
					      (2^n    to     O(n) {greedy} ) 
     Similar prob. to above. is 739. Daily Temperatures ( O(n^2) --- O(N) Monotonic Stack )



646. Maximum Length of Pair Chain     ( Recursive simlar to Weighted Job Schdeuling ) pehlan sort... fer decisions lenee a..
								( Greedy Apraoch ) Proof of This Greedy very beautifully explained by-> https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/discuss/225801/Proof-of-the-greedy-solution

	 One Interserting thing about this que. the Greedy we used in it is not useful in {Weighted} Job Scheduling bcz.--
	 In this greedy our attempt is to maximize the length ..(as each pair as a unit(1) value ) so no problem at all.
	 Whereas in Weighted Job Scheduling our attempt is to Maximize profit and it's not necessary that the maximum no.
	    of Interviews which can be scheduled without overlapping can give max. profit{it's obvious} so that'why in 
		 that ques. we have to use Recusiion to figure out all possible cases....


1288.Remove Covered Intervals   .....V good question...by sorting on the basis of end time miss this test case...-->
									{34,39} {29,66} {53,69} {15,91} {40,93} No. of covered Intervals = 3. so O/t = 5-3=2

		   Best Explanation == https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-covered-intervals/discuss/878981/C%2B%2B-Sort-with-Brief-Explanation-O(nlogn)-Runtime-O(1)-Memory
						
						So if tail > next_tail then sort on the bais of {{start}}....   
						
491  Increasing Subseq.. = similart to combination Sum2...
				    Great Learning-->  we can use set or std::unquie to remove duplicates subsets so no need to worry about duplicates elements present..
